# Product Guidelines - Grid Electric Services Platform

## Visual Identity & Aesthetic: "Utility-Dark"
- **Primary Theme:** Professional & Utility-Focused. 
- **Palette:** A deep, high-contrast palette of navy blues, charcoal slates, and safety-critical accent colors (Success Green, Warning Amber, Danger Red).
- **Legibility:** Prioritize high-contrast typography and large touch targets to ensure usability in high-glare outdoor environments and for users wearing protective gear.
- **Status Indicators:** Every task, equipment item, and assessment must have a clear, color-coded status indicator.

## Voice & Tone: Authoritative & Precise
- **Communication Style:** Direct, technical, and safety-oriented.
- **Imperative Logic:** Use clear, unambiguous commands (e.g., "Scan QR Code," "Confirm Check-Out," "Upload Damage Photo") to minimize user hesitation.
- **Safety First:** Language should reflect the high-stakes nature of utility work, emphasizing verification and compliance at every step.

## Core Design Values
- **Transparency & Integrity:** Design every feature to build a "Trustless" audit trail. This includes GPS-verified timestamps, immutable logs, and mandatory photo evidence for all field assessments.
- **Operational Excellence:** Workflows are engineered to eliminate "digital friction." The interface should lead the user through the fastest path to complete a task correctly.
- **System-Enforced Precision:** Minimize human error by utilizing predefined selection lists, strict data validation rules, and mandatory input fields.

## Operational Standards
- **Validation-Driven Workflows:** Instead of manual reviews for every action, the system uses strict logic to ensure data is correct at the point of entry. 
- **Integrity over Speed:** While speed is important, the system will not allow a user to skip mandatory validation steps, ensuring the final output (e.g., an assessment or inventory log) is 100% accurate and compliant.
